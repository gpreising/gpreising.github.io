	<p>Hello! I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://schumerlab.com/" target="_blank">Schumer lab</a> as part of the Stanford Biology PhD program.
		I’m broadly interested in genomics, but in particular mapping the genetic basis of simple and complex traits, studying gene flow between species, and understanding the evolutionary history of traits using phylogenomics and other computational tools.
		To this end, I use the incredibly diverse <i>Xiphophorus</i> genus as a model system, as well as humans/archaic hominins.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I earned my B.A. in biology from Reed College (’20) where I discovered my interests in behavioral neuroscience (in the <a href="https://www.reed.edu/biology/renn/" target="_blank">Renn lab</a>) and computational biology (in the <a href="https://www.reed.edu/biology/ritz/compbiolab.html" target="_blank">Ritz lab</a>).
		Upon graduating, I was awarded a NIH-funded post-bac research position between the Renn and Ritz labs. In my free time, I enjoy playing music with my band, rock climbing, and spending time outdoors.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Please feel free to reach out! I’m always happy to chat about science :)</p>
